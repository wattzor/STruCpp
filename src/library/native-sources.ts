 * Native (non-ST) library sources — C/C++ and Python function blocks.
 *
 * A library may ship function blocks whose bodies are written in C/C++ or
 * Python rather than Structured Text. STruC++ does not compile those bodies:
 * it **transports** them. The archive carries the authored file verbatim and
 * the consuming toolchain lowers it at *its* build time, against whatever
 * native bridge that toolchain implements.
 *
 * That distinction is the whole point and must not be optimised away. If a
 * future version compiled these bodies instead, the resulting archive would
 * encode one fixed bridge ABI, and every library published before a bridge
 * change would stop building until it was recompiled. Transporting the source
 * keeps a published library working across bridge revisions.
 *
 * What STruC++ *does* read is the ST header every such file carries — the
 * `FUNCTION_BLOCK <name>` line plus its `VAR_*` blocks. That is ordinary ST,
 * so the interface is recovered by the ordinary parser and the block lands in
 * the manifest looking like any other, distinguished only by
 * `implementation: "cpp" | "python"`. The body between the last `END_VAR` and
 * the closing `END_FUNCTION_BLOCK` is never parsed.
