/**
 * iec_fault.hpp — unrecoverable-fault handling for the STruC++ runtime.
 *
 * STruC++ runs on two very different classes of target:
 *
 *   - Hosted (Linux/Windows OpenPLC runtime, the REPL, the test harness):
 *     compiled WITH C++ exceptions. Runtime faults `throw`, and the host
 *     catches them — e.g. to stop the offending POU while the rest of the
 *     program keeps scanning, or to print a diagnostic and exit cleanly.
 *
 *   - Freestanding (microcontroller firmware: AVR, SAMD, RP2040, STM32, …):
 *     compiled with `-fno-exceptions`. There is nothing to catch a throw and
 *     the C++ exception runtime is dead weight (~10-15 KB of unwinder), so
 *     instead of throwing, the runtime calls `iec_runtime_fault()`.
 *
 * The selection is keyed off whether the *compiler* has exceptions enabled
 * (`STRUCPP_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`), NOT off any particular chip macro — so every
 * `-fno-exceptions` target uniformly takes the fault path with no per-board
 * flags.
