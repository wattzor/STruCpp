// WARNING: KEEP THIS HEADER C++14-CLEAN (see iec_var.hpp for the full rationale).
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This header is included by strucpp's emitted code, which on some Arduino cores
// (mbed-based: Nano RP2040/33 BLE, Opta, GIGA, Portenta, Edge) is compiled under
// `-std=gnu++14`. Do NOT use C++17/20 features unguarded (no `if constexpr`, no
// `std::trait_v`, no inline variables, no <optional>/<variant>/<string_view>).
// `auto` return-type deduction and generic/`decltype` trailing returns are C++14
// and OK. The <mutex> include + all locks are `#ifdef STRUCPP_THREADED`, so the
// baremetal (Arduino) build never pulls them in. Codegen emits with_lock()
// lambdas with CONCRETE parameter types (not `auto*`) to stay portable.

/**
 * @file iec_global.hpp
 * @brief Shared-global wrapper (value + per-global mutex) for VAR_GLOBAL /
 *        VAR_EXTERNAL.
 *
 * A CONFIGURATION `VAR_GLOBAL` is emitted as a `GlobalVar<V>` MEMBER of the
 * configuration — one object bundling the canonical storage (`value`, the real
 * IEC type, e.g. `IEC_BOOL` or a function-block type) with that global's own
 * mutex. A PROGRAM's `VAR_EXTERNAL` reference is emitted as a plain
 * `GlobalVar<V>*` pointing at that single canonical object. There is exactly one
 * mutex per global (it lives on the canonical); locking "through the external
 * pointer" locks the shared canonical.
 *
 *   - NON-THREADED (baremetal / single task): the mutex and locks compile out;
 *     accesses go straight to `value`. Zero overhead.
 *
 *   - STRUCPP_THREADED (openplc-runtime v4): every access (read / write / field
 *     / FB call) is serialized on the global's own mutex — fine-grained, so a
 *     lock is held for exactly one access and never nested with another global's
 *     lock (deadlock-free). Contract: per-access validity (no torn read/write);
 *     conflicts resolve last-writer-in-time. Data-agnostic — scalars, structs,
 *     arrays, and FB instances all work, and different-field writes from
 *     different tasks all survive because they mutate the one shared object.
 *
 * read() returns the real IEC value type — `V` itself, i.e. `IECVar<T>`, NOT the
 * underlying `T`. That matters for deduction: the constrained std-lib templates
 * take one shared parameter for both operands (`template<typename T> T ADD(T, T)`),
 * and locals, literals and composite-global fields all present as `IECVar<T>`.
 * Returning `T` here would make a scalar global the one operand kind that differs,
 * and `ADD(aGlobal, aLocal)` would fail to deduce — implicit conversions are not
 * considered during template argument deduction, so `operator T()` cannot rescue it.
 * Forcing is preserved: the copy handed back is built through the canonical's
 * get(), so it carries the effective forced value (with the force flag cleared, as
 * a detached snapshot should); located globals additionally honor the image
 * forced-slot bitmap.
