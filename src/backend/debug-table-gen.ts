 * STruC++ Debug Table Generator
 *
 * Emits two artifacts alongside the normal compile() output:
 *
 *   1. `debugTableCpp` — contents for generated_debug.cpp, the per-project
 *      pointer tables consumed by strucpp::debug::handle_*() in the runtime
 *      header debug_dispatch.hpp.
 *
 *   2. `debugMap` — a JSON-serializable manifest the editor uses to translate
 *      variable paths (e.g. "INSTANCE0.speeds[5]") into the (arrayIdx,
 *      elemIdx) address pairs the target expects.
 *
 * Every leaf variable — including array elements, struct fields, and FB
 * input/output/inout members — gets its own entry. Leaves are packed into
 * arrays capped at 8,000 entries to stay below AVR GCC's 32,767-byte
 * single-object limit. A new array is also started at each program-instance
 * boundary so per-program edits don't cascade down the table.
