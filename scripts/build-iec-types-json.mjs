 * Emit `libs/iec-types.json` — the canonical IEC base-type registry

 * replacement, third-party tooling).
 *
 * The data is hand-authored in `src/semantic/iec-types-data.ts`; this
 * script transcodes it to JSON and writes it next to the .stlib
 * archives. Both source and artifact are committed — strucpp's own
 * code reads the TS module directly (typed, fast) and external
 * consumers read the JSON via `node_modules/strucpp/libs/iec-types.json`.
 *
 * A `schemaVersion` field guards against silent shape drift: bump it
 * here whenever IECTypeMetadata gains/loses/renames a field, and any
 * out-of-date editor will fail loudly on first read instead of
 * silently mis-parsing.
