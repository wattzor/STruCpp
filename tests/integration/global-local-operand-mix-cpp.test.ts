/**
 * DOPE-613 — a block whose inputs mix a global and a local.

 * `GlobalVar::read()` used to return the *underlying* scalar (`value.get()`)
 * rather than the IEC value type `V`. Locals, literals and composite-global
 * fields all present as `IECVar<T>`, so a scalar global was the one operand kind
 * that differed, and the constrained std-lib templates — which take a single
 * shared parameter for both operands, `template<typename T> T ADD(T, T)` —
 * failed to deduce:
 *
 *     error: no matching function for call to 'ADD(int, strucpp::IEC_INT&)'
 *     note: deduced conflicting types for parameter 'T'
 *           ('int' and 'strucpp::IECVar<int>')
 *
 * `operator T()` cannot rescue this: implicit conversions are not considered
 * during template argument deduction.
 *
 * These tests are end-to-end through g++ on purpose. The defect lived entirely
 * in C++ overload resolution — ST → C++ translation succeeded the whole time —
 * so a codegen-string assertion would have stayed green throughout.
